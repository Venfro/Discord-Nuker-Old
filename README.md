# Venfro's Discord Nuker
- I made this because I was bored, it doesn't work and I don't really promote nuking servers.
- This was intended to work as a selfbot.

## Required Dependencies
- dotenv
- axios

## How to install
```
1. Install Node.JS (I recommend LTS)
2. Download the repository
3. Type npm install dotenv and npm install axios inside the command prompt
4. Put your account token and guild id inside of the .env file
5. Type npm index.js or npm start to start the bot.
```

# Note: It doesn't work and I will never plan on ever making it work, this is just an archive on a project I made 2 years ago, and I simply just updated to the latest APIs.
